Francesca Ashley Inguito,1,"This was awful, the dialogue of characters in story's take to long, even that alone takes me out, and lantern rite AFTER the archon Mavuika debuts?! It's honestly baffling, I'll take the time to list all the flaws in my opinion. It focuses on only one opinion of one side, I'm talking about how they only the opinion of Chinese players, Its one sided, The designs, for me, its natlan designs, for example, chasca, she does NOT fit in with the cultures of natlan, I'd say more but wouldnt fit."

Mohamad Indra N.,1,"The lack of a skip button is one of my main reasons to quit and convert to WuWa. It's beyond irritating doing humongous yapping fest quests with dogshit stories, dialogues, and recycled animations. It's time-consuming and infuriating. You wanna make the players pay attention to the story? Then make a good story with engaging storytelling. Instead of a boring yapping fest which you force players to get through. I'll never return to the game and stick to WuWa until they add it."

artik5552,1,"Basically to sum everything in one, this game is a waste of your time and a tricksteri. As hoyoverse do not respect your hard earned primogems.They just want you to spend money. Wasted 50 k gems on the 50/50 system. Like if we don't spend enough gems already just to get what we want,hey? Noo,spend more!lose more 50/50 to get unneeded stuff you won't ever need and same goes for weapon banner not only character banner. Don't play this Game,for your own good."

Adem Zaghdoudi,5,"To the esteemed Hoyoverse team, Warm greetings, I am one of the passionate fans of your exceptional game,and as an Arabic-speaking player, I would like to kindly request that you consider adding Arabic as a supported language in the game's interface and translations. Arabic holds a significant global position, with over 400 million speakers, and there is a large community of Arab players who love and enjoy your game Adding Arabic would not only attract more Arab players but also enhance game"

Emmanuel Rosado,1,Telling content creators to not play Wuthering Waves just cause they don't want competition is a bad look. I understand there's people who enjoy genshin but there's people who also enjoy Waves and there isn't anything wrong with that. Maybe make your game better and you'd get your fans you lost there's a reason why Genshin players are switching and prefer Wuthering Waves. Competition is suppose to push you to be better not be weak and beg people to play your lackluster game
Larc Moore,5,It was fun

erenjaeuwus,3,"Ive played since new year of 2021. Love the game its very pretty and very fun. But the RNG is ATROCIOUS. The amount of long dialogues there are lack of animation is awkward. The world quests should be voiced. Natlan is cool but not what 80% of the fanbase expected...it feels too colorful for a region of war. Fontaine was perfect. This game is dear to my heart, but I genuinely believe it can SO much better. It feels like a chore now when I used to play it everyday, now it feels annoying to play"

Jon,2,"Everything is great except the dialogues. I thought I was the only one annoyed by the too-long-winded dialogues. I'm playing a game but reading through all the words feel like a job. Why couldn't it be like ""Hey, Traveler. I need this blah-blah-blah. It is located in x location"". You go there, get the item and come back. The NPC says TY and you get your reward. Also, I think the once or twice a week boss battles are too restrictive. Also, the specific reward days domains are frustrating."
Liba Khan,5,Hey HoYoverse! I love the game so much it's very addictive but the thing is.. Could you please for the co-op make us be able to search for friends by their user instead of UID? I lost a very close friend of mine somehow and I didn't copy down their UID and I struggle to find him.. His user is Apoorva and bio was Aakash If you find him then please email me or something!

sweep,1,"as someone who dedicated 9 months of my life into this game for no particular reason, i hate everything about it, i will never play it again, and probably will never come back to future updates, this is a warning for every new player, either play the story and uninstall, or dont mess with this cringey game, and the team behind it, stay away as far as you can"

Repetitive, little to no variations. Gacha system is annoying. Also heavy on device, potato phone better not try. Every QoL improvent asked by players will go to Hoyoverse other game instead (cough*HSR*cough), while the one that implemented *will* cost something. Its like they don't want to give player good things without extracting high cost."

Alex Salgado,5,It kept me entertained for hours and hours
Mariam Reda,4,"Genshin is honestly a great game but there are some issues I have to point out. Firstly, the extra long dialogues in the quest and you can't skip it (you basically have to listen to the characters yapping for 5 mins ). Secondly, why is there no offline option when playing solo and you also need like 20GB to download this game as well as another 8GB for updates which is really annoying. Lastly, this game takes up a lot of time and it is really hard to get the 5 stars you want as a F2P player."
Maria Guerra,1,"The game was almost something that everyone or most genshin fans would love the things that came into life in the game with its music, characters, and story that aligned with things in the real world and it's cultures but after Natlan, It's almost felt as if that everything that came out went out of the window when there has been characters coming out that didn't represent well of actual cultures and it's upsetting to me and I assume others too who play the game, I hope the issue can be solved."
Sharman Singh,5,Amazing adventure games I love it ‚ù§Ô∏è

Grey Valen,1,"I can no longer support this game, their toxicity towards their creators and desire to control said creators has gone too far. This game already struggles from being inferior to newer titles, which normally hasn't been an issue for me, I still enjoyed it. However, I value playing games for companies that at minimum pretend to care for their players/creators. This is no longer the hoyoverse I remember from the ""honkai impact 3rd"" days. They don't care about their players like their competitors."

QoL in this game is pay walled and region locked, players are never appreciated during important milestones, exploration is a nightmare, story is (imo) shallow and uninspired, devs (hoyo) never listens to feedback. Finally cured the sunk cost fallacy which prevented me from quitting before, thank you for sucking too much hoyo. One more thing. Wuthering waves is better and genshin could never"

Velvette,5,Been playing for days now I love it I've lost count on how many days it's been I wake up early just to keep playing I love this game tho I wish we could have an update for the gliders experience and such like when there's a mountain and the character that is good at climbing died and you don't have any food to revive them and don't wanna keep going back and forth to the god and have them alive them just to climb again I'm asking is there a way we can fly higher with the gliders?

Glads,5,I love open world games and Genshin has so many spots and fun quests you can fight super cool bosses and unlock side stories. I think my only problem is how I don't have the best amount of storage with this game but otherwise this is a game I recommend since it's so action filled and customized to the player.

Yvonne Taylor,5,I can play on my phone when I don't want to turn my PS4 on. It's so much fun! The story telling is on point and the different characters are exiting to learn. It helps me escape from reality.
Danya Loera,3,"Love the game, I pretty recently started playing and quickly became obsessed. There's a few issues though, my storage is very quickly running out and with each update the lingering fear that my phone will not longer be able to take it is there, I don't have a PC or gaming console that would support this game either so mobile is all I have. I'd hate to have to quit just because of this. Second I feel like the characters as a whole just keep disappointing a bit, compared to in other hoyo games"

Amber,1,"Okay at the start but the amount of storage it takes up is ridiculous. I use to be able to play before the Fontaine update, but after that the storage was too big. When I downloaded it, I had to delete almost everything on my phone to play, and I can't even get it at all on my PC. It's not fair that many players have to give up almost everything on their devices to play one single game. No wonder so many players are leaving. Please sort this out."
Yennis,2,"The game offers an amazing view and good exploration! Only if you have a good device and rich in pulls. Many exploration mechanisms are locked behind limited characters' kits and the game's generosity is absolutely outrageous! In a day, I've barely been even able to farm A SINGLE PULL if not then it'll mostly be 0. Just last year in 5.0 update, they finally decided to give out a free 5 star character. Game has been out for years yet they can't even get new animations or heck even lip scyn."
Oracle Plays,1,"4 years in, genshin still doesn't have a proper QOL. Heck... Even Android doesn't have controller support yet. I hate that I am hating the game that help me get through the Pandemic because of the repetitive process and tediousness of the game has become. It feels like genshin devs feels tone deaf. If you want to retain players, have a better QOL and allow players to obtain 5 star char skins by grinding the game so they feel rewarded."
Zizi,1,"Game pelit, kikir ngasih bansos dikit doang, gb doang gede tapi kikirnya minta ampun. Game jelek setidaknya gacha rate nya naikin lah klo kikir susah banget lagi farmingnya ini gw kasih bintang 1 karena kasian padahal pengennya mah bintang 0 soalnya ni game jelek banget kikir lagi. Karakter nya juga bajunya terlalu terbuka. Banyak gooner. Game fanservice katanya bapaklu fan service. Benerin game kikir lu hoyo. Kesel banget mainnya.

Kasacchi,1,"I feel disappointed a lot with the natlan update, it's a well done but it breaks my good view towards this game. None of my expectations is fulfilled, the game also didn't take the player's feedback seriously. And also my biased complaint is that, if you're about to make a new flying character, at least make the old one relevant too, give it as much as flexibility as the new one. I'm planning to leave this game after the next update, thankyou for accompanying me for 4 years."

Kazuma Ryou,3,I really enjoyed the game for a few months but As I go farther into the game I get really frustrated tapping the dialogue especially for the background characters so I hope that in the future You will add the SKIP button for the people who just want to play cuz of gamestyle/gameplay

Hazelwynne Robertson,1,"I used to really enjoy this game, but ever since Nathan it has all became fan service, and rhw whole of Nathan just doesn't fit the state of Teyvat, the lore is bland and boring, the designs are extremely out of no where, trust me they would've been better if they had darker skin but the new characters just looks like a bunch of night lights because of how light-skinned they are. Honestly the game has truly and heavily fell off"

The Radish,1,Since it's a gotcha the game developers really only care about getting money from players so rather than giving better in game rewards they do everything they can to incentive players to spend real life money which is predatory not to meantion the quality of the game is arguable especially since natlan
Ckxy 0811,5,"I love this game sm. No lag or glitches. You need quite high Internet quality and storage though I don't mind. Recommend playing on PC instead of phone. Perfect quality graphic design with amazing story quests designs. Characters are all great, though the wishing system could be a little better like Honkai star rail but overall everything is great. The characters are well written and the quests about them are all interesting. A little comedy sometimes as well."
Pat,5,Cool gamee
yaser ghasempor,1,"The chance percentage in Asura is low. Finding any item on the map is impossible and very rare. Every time a new season of the game comes out, the game becomes childish and simple. There is little excitement in the game and the power of each character is low."

Ayush Narayan,1,"I have 1270 days active, honestly the game was amazing back in 2020 and until 2022. After that the game went downhill with bad updates, no end game content, bad story progression, bad gacha system and story quests were lacking with VAs in some parts. The game is good in terms of quality with animation, scenery and combat a little but went off with the wrong track. Devs barley give out rewards which makes it hard to get new characters if you lose 50/50 and characters are constellation dependent"
Genevieve Requino,5,The best game ever the quality is so good and the story of archon are so nice üëçüèº i recommend to play but the olny problem the storage you need a good quality phone to play this game

k yoisaki,1,NEED MORE FREEMOGEMS
aira,1,"The game uses cultures, and real countries as inspiration for the nations in the game and the characters that live in said nation. However, the game's lack of diversity despite the game wanting to represent the country and it's people. I've genuinely enjoyed the game up until Natlan, where this nation is too gimmicky and has a noticable higher amount of female characters due to reasons regarding fanservice making said characters lose out on their potential."

RIN,4,"Dropped this mid-year 2024. I remember that excitement of playing for the first time and the adventures I looked forward to, but now.. i felt like I wasn't getting where I wanted to be. Plus there's just way too many side quests and little things that just drags everything. Game is still special to me since I was playing this when I had nothing to do. Even though I dropped it and how much it frustrated me. Genshit is special ‚ú®Ô∏è"
One Kid,4,"Amazing game, I have more than a 1000 hours and experienced basically everything. The story is fine, the combat is *really* good and the open world is very stunning and a lot of effort is put into it. However I started to get less interested in the game recently because of the new characters and their mechanics... I play the game today mostly because of the combat, grinding doesn't really pay off since it's basically never useful because of the lack of content. Please make more use of it hoyo ü•∫"
Dramana 22,1,"New players should not start playing this game. From the poor real life representation, to a heavy bearing load of a game, any new people looking to play is better off playing other games and get better results if they wanted a more progressive game"

Zack,1,"Genshin Impact used to be one of the best open world game on mobile back in it's early years. Nowadays it seems the game has strayed further and further from being the best. Ignoring the obvious racist problem in this game, GI has consistently catered to the sad lonely group of men who play this game for innapropriate reasons. Citlali and Mavuika are one of the examples. Besides that, GI also has a bad problem with grinding."

Andrew Masters,1,"What you see in the trailers ehere character have voices, most characters in-game are muted due to the fact that when you hire Americans English Voice actors, they go on strike and the characters you paid for doesnt have any voice.

Abby Fuentes,3,I've been playing Genshin for a long time and I have loved every bit of this game until now because tell me why I LOST my flippin account hoyoverse.

nayan,1,"This game always lacked more content and mechanics and endgames truly awful management and monetizing. Played it till 4.4 i think cuz there wasn't any better options back then but now i moved to wuwa. It's thousand time better game and devs actually listen to their players. Genshin for me, it's just an exhausting game with no content and for the only purpose of milking your wallet"

Rohit Biswas,1,Would rate 0 if I could I logged in on my birthday to get my birthday cake via in game mail and did not receive it i thought it was some kind of error and after wating for it someday I sent a feedback to which the genshin cs crew replied i did not logged in on my birthday the kept constantly arguing that I hadn't logged in on my birthday but the thing is I had i even have app data usage record of genshin that proves that I was playing the game on my birthday!!!

Sayan Das,5,This is a really nice game but I would love the developers to make a LITE version of this game that requires less storage and less system requirements for low end devices.
Vergel Terrible,5,The game is awesomeness even the low ping it's working smooth even when I invite friends to my world it's excellent but please add like voice chat it's hard to communicate in chat only.
Jon Thornton,5,Very addictive game would like three things to make it better.1 to be able to completely shut off paimon in settings just paimon no one else. 2 no limit on range to sneak quests foe story like following keijiro tracks for inazuma. 3to be able to stop and gain accessibility for Co-op when I don't fell like doing archon quests

Natlan kinda disappoints me tho... anywyas. SHENZNAYA BETTER HAVE A LOT OF CRYO RERUNS AND STUFFüó£Ô∏èüó£Ô∏èüó£Ô∏è"
Aminur Rahman,2,"Loved this game till the dialogue became too long and overwhelming. The latest natlan content was too much of a stale dialogue, quests like move to locations for more dialogue, no skip button or anything, it made it increasingly boring. Uninteresting. Before i would play between my work schedules, now id spend all that on freaking dialogues. I got so much content to catch up on, i dont need the hour long dialogues in between. This fast paced game should consider players with little time on hand"

Sakura,3,"love it, it's beautiful with amazing characters with all different writings that make it interesting. if only that last part was true. often repetitive character personalitys which relatively the same back stories. no skip option, which is annoying for the 15 mins of dialogue this game has. the characters are often revealing(especially females) and are not culturally accurate. The male characters are nice though, its just sometimes they get pushed to the side for the females. not enought primos."

Alex Hong,2,"while I really like the game, if i'm just rating the android version, it's 2/5 for me since they refuse to add controller support for android after so many years. with more complicated movement mechanics from the environment & characters, it's becoming a literal pain to play the game on a touch screen when exploring & doing longer combat events. due to how much my right thumb need to move around & tap on screen, it would ache after just a short while. add controller support & it'll be an ez 5/5."

Keron Lewis,5,I ‚ù§Ô∏è genshin_impact i love the scenery it calms my heart. I just wish my phone could handle the full graphics
Ariane Magbanua,4,"It's my third time playing this game. The graphics were so amazing and, I love how the other places so breathtaking. The only problem is that, the storyline doesn't have a skip. I suggest, to implement a skip icon so that, it won't be boring for me."
Victor Platon,1,"The game is a big is a big disappointment. It's nice in the beginning, and then is just a boring slow text that you need to read. The events are lackluster. The story, apart from 2 chapters, is uninteresting. The main character is useless, and his story is forgotten. The devs take no feedback and if they do it takes years to implement something."
S Raman,5,My favorite game
Darrell Pang,5,So cool
Anurag,5,It is the most realistic 3D game that u can play on your mobile. It's just take a few time to download the game as it takes apx-30 GB of internet.

Sugi Hachi Ishigami,3,"Okay, this game is really good, everything is detailed, alot of culture inspired places and really cool mechanisms for battle, intresting ways of building a character, all are good..except for a thing, CHARACTER DESIGNS. Im not saying all of them are bad, their stories , and everything are good its just not unique (starting from skin colour too) its all the same pale White, and only some are tan, understand designing a character is Hard, but other games i played has more diversed."

Vibhav Kandala,1,It pains me to give this game such a small review because this game was so good and I have been playing for more then 3 years. Genshin will always be the savior of COVID to me and I will cherish it. I just feel like this game wasn't as good as it used to be. Now the biggest reason I play genshin is the characters. The characters in genshin are amazing. But there are way too many females compared to males and I fear this will be a Honkai impact situation. There needs to be more diversity.

Kelly Dube,1,I hate this game so much!!! It took me 6 or 7 hours just to get to 40%
I A,1,"This game really cheats you out of everything and spits at your face 12/25/24: This game has come a long way and I've played up to Natlan. I thought it was doing better with Fontaine, story quest was good, character stories and adding resin but Natlan itself has killed the game for me. The character designs have very much continued to downgrade, Natlan story looks unfinished and like it was clearly overwritten. The grinding and cut scenes i can't skip of mediocre scenes make this unplayable"
Britt Richins,5,This game is so good
bon,2,The game's getting boring and Natlan sucks
Ayla Pisello,5,Character designs are absolutely beautiful and it's a super enjoyable story
Omar NTZ1,1,"I just don't like the new direction of the game, it's a childish direction that reduces the male characters and focuses on the females for those sims. Even the new male characters are disgusting and the new areas are childish. I feel like they're making areas with a lot of childish colors and the missions are repetitive and boring. The game has lost its special charm that it was distinguished by in the beginning."
Kent Martinez,5,Free archon pls

irfanthaqif,4,Best
Tommy Lor,1,"Plus stop making your event mini game trash. The game is already have alot of gacha system. Don't making your event games gacha. It makes it worse now that you put 2 new 5 stars together. That's so dumb, you can make more money if separated but I see you're just a bunch of high schoolers making a game. No wonder you're here making this kind of game. Honestly, this game HAD potential, but sadly just dumb high scho- I mean Dev."
Furina,5,Needs 20+ Gb but it's so worth it
Ghost of the fallen Valkyrie,1,"Sad to say it peaked in Fontaine- Natlan is honestly a huge disappointment. The explo is fine w/ Saurians, but the phlogiston depletes too fast and some of the Saurians are really awful to control on console. The powercreep is getting worse and the only QoL updates are built in the limited characters. The rewards to effort ratio is horrible. The lack of diversity in characters is horrible. ZZZ n genshin are blending together now. Lots of unnecessarily long writing, especially in world quests."
Pal,3,"pls hoyo give me mavuika, citlali, and chlorine on next patch. if i get them, i will give 5 star for u."

Dartaficial,2,"A while ago this was my favorite game but, while having it's flaws, it kept showing quite a bit of improvement story wise, the new areas were always fun to explore and that was the case until Natlan came along. Recently in my opinion it's gotten quite boring and I don't find myself caring about the story at all and the exploration feels lacking, most of the characters don't have great designs. I hope they make some changes with the future updates or at least next nation."

Moron GoaT,1,More endgame content plz
Yellowwwool ‚Ä¢,1,"I started playing about a month after the release and have played regularly since. I use to find genshin impact very enjoyable, but recently I've found it increasingly difficult to continue playing. The absolute refusal to listen to suggestions and recommendations has impacted the game negatively. Fanservice is so heavily laid on that it completely destroys the amazing plotlines. It's upsetting to see a game with such potential be reduced to fanservice and repetitive designs."

Cemo,4,Genshin Impact is a beautiful game and I love playing it everyday. But I have one problem. Genshin Impact doesn't accept controller or keyboard on Samsung mobile devices. I want to play with my controller but I cannot because of this. As far as I know based on research it does accept controllers and keyboards on Apple devices. Please also make it available for Samsung devices.
Vaibhav Singh,1,Gacha is rigged. You get attached to game by playing story and then it's forces you to spend money. Of course they will always say that no one is forcing you to spend. But at the same time they can't improve their gacha system ( because it would lower their profits by abusing players)

Gaming Account,1,"‚òÖ Dark texture in Natlan Environment ‚òÖ Can you please help me with my problem? Since the drop of natlan the environment there especially the land is black. My device is Poco x6 pro 5g w/ 12/512 variant. I tried setting my graphics to default, clearing cache then reinstalling the game. Nothings happened still got the black land in natlan."
Nattasha lala,5,"I will give you 1 star untill you buff my love Dehya. Come on give her some love, she's weaker than 4 star characters now."
Steph Ocampo,3,Yall stingy af
Noel Jade,2,"I really wish that they would give you an option to lower the environment detail even more since my device is extremely weak and even when all of the graphic settings are on the lowest option the game is still quite demanding, examples of this are: there are a lot of non-interactable flowers that are rendered in 3D and it would really be nice if on the lowest settings they were to be rendered as flat, option to turn off footprints and sand trails, and option to lower the amount of particles."
Real Builders,5,I love this game it's so fun and the story is so enjoyable but can I ask how to play online.

Tama ya,5,"Gak bisa komentar apa-apa... Intinya permainannya seru, bagus"
Dmitry Razumov,1,"Genshin now is embodiment of boredom. The current gameplay of the game, all sorts of modes, constantly puts you on deadlines or ""must do activities"", adding toxic FOMO rewards... Your game turned into hell routine. I don't see reason to get any new characters - they will sit on bench for ages, waiting for normal (not even good) equipment. I don't enjoy exploration anymore - chill activity turned into tedious task, with problematic backtracking if you didn't noted everything on first run"

Riva Kristina Vergara,4,Not emough males and has become boring
Robbie Jules Benedito,4,"I've been playing this game for ages now and one thing to say is that natlan is a hype! Although most people don't like the character designs, the characters are so op. Lastly, I hadn't deleted the game yet which was good. Pretty fun experience but the lack of content made me the type of player who usually logs in for commission and event unlike the past when I was new to the game that I would play for around 4-6hrs a day, maybe also due to my studies, but I'm waiting for 5.3 archon quest!! üî•üî•"

„Åä„Å°„ÇÉ„ÇÇ„Å°,2,"NATLAN. I hate how they turned citlali into simploli/citloli. Keep in mind that citlali literally was drunk in the archon quest and is called ""granny itzli"". Also Mahuikas design??? It genuinely feels ot of place. She had markings on her during capitano fight, and they werent seen because of how pale she is. Natlan designs genuinely feel out of place, considering the technology like a...motorcycle. she's the only one who has it in WHOLE teyvat, too. Natlan was 100% rewritten last second i fear."

However, the game is beautiful and has a really interesting and deep plot. I just wish that it was a little easier. Also more male characters and black characters! Add diversity!"
Spiderbrox,5,The game is the best game ever I joined just a month after it's official release say on December and it was a memorable journey the trailer and cut scenes have improved alot even character from limited to f2p option I hope that it would be easier for us old player to try and get some extra mora and exp books and a increase in resine as it would help alot not a bit increase maybe up to 300 or so other then that it is amazing from storyline to the gameplay it is my no.1 game in my phone!!!!!!!!!!!

Tana K,1,Bad. Several reasons Pros: Graphics Cons: Gacha Less rewards Boring dialogue Repetative exploration Limited time events Cliche story Too many boring things to do Limited time rewards Grinding No replayability Less frequent updates Resin I started playing this game because of the map expansions which are now lesser than before since 5.0 patch.
David White,5,I really love genshin it's an open world play game it's has many quests and voice overs my favorite character may be jean she's an anemo character she's a good healer on her squad even though it has a long download and update it is very very very worth it see u in Co cop bye thank u for reading this

paramjeet singh,5,I have been only playing the game for a couple of days and I'm already falling in love with the graphics and story
Rylle Klee,1,"Overall good game up to Fontaine region. Our MC doesn't say much and it feels off. Some improvements here and there after 4 years thanks to competition. Graphics should be improved for high performing mobile phones, not just iPhones. Very stingy and vain, you also have to pay for in-game currency to cover for stamina/resin, otherwise tasks are very expensive even for a casual player. Story wise lacks a lot due to focus on sexualised female characters."

OSSMBOY,4,I have been playing for 3 years & i loved it very much. Now a days it's not that exciting and devs are just making this game more casual than hardcore. I tried new games such as ToF & WuWa. I don't know why but genshin still shines brighter than those games. I know Devs are lazy to make their game better but players are gonna play & spend on it no matter what which is huge problem. But i say this game has the charm that can't be created by those 2 games above. I hope devs listen to us players.
Leta King,1,"I liked the game for a while, but it's starting to feel like a chore to do quests. They're so long, and it gets boring too fast. I would love the game so much if they just added a skip button. Wish they listened to their player base a bit more, too. And, please, stop turning this into a waifu simulator, most people don't like it."

Arsalaan LaFleur,1,"Still no controller support for Android, and we're going into 2025...this game deserves its low rating"
selina w,3,"Beautiful and addictive game, but once you get past like the first 2 story arcs, rewards significantly drop and game becomes much more grindy and less friendly to casuals/f2ps. Character progression/artifact system is extremely grindy, but that wouldn't be a problem if the gameplay was actually fun. You are stuck replaying the same battle (domain) over and over, for months, just to boost your character's stats by like 1 percent. The grindiness of this game really offputs me from playing longterm"
Pepe Rivas,5,"Beautiful just beautiful Amazing graphic, storyline, just everything in general is so good 10/10."

Narh Alexander,5,This takes 10 hours to load I can't wait that longüò°
Talyx,1,"This game set the base standard for what a gacha mixed with an mmo that its mostly a single player game with nice co-op should be, sadly lies and company greed, and most importantly, too comfortable with first place ruined what this game was and could've been. Hoyo lost all credibility and trust from their players. If you want a good hoyo game, play honkai star rail, but I would suggest staying away from anything with hoyoverse on its name. Play wuthering waves instead."
Sage Fischer,1,Very cringe
Duck_Blox,2,"I had an old account in this game connected to my Gmail long ago. I un-installed the game to free up some space on my phone but then I got bored and downloaded it again, I tried logging in with the same Gmail that was connected to my old account hoping to get it back but it didn't work.

Guse 0,2,"The game is alright. Since I pre-registered and kind of left my account sit for some time, I was able to stock up on in-game currency which made it easier, but in a sense, it doesn't really feel like a game because of how simple and grind it is. I barely had enough to get 3 characters, which I've heard is just because the start of the game is more opening, with the further you delve into the game, making it even more difficult for you to obtain what you want. Again, it's okay, but just okay."
Boutros Ogalo Amun RA,5,"I was one of the GP irst to play this game back when it wasn't on Playstore, sad to se that it's still Not possible to select different shades of people"

Louwe Jucar,3,In all honesty this game is really good but the rewards it's not getting better üòî
Jaylxn,1,"The fan service on Citlati is actually insane. I love this game so much, but when you take every female character and somehow sexualize them to the ""fans"" an angel looses it wings. She's supposed to be a literal granny, not a little tsundere. She'd be so much more enjoyable if she had a personality like Faruzan. Especially the scene with Lumine and Aether side by side, the excessive blushing for Aether? Seriously? Do better Genshin."

Aniket Mondal,5,"The game is too much grinding before you can enjoy the story everytime you progress. Need option in settings that would make Mouse/Touch ""Look"" control smooth like controller. Current control jitters with mouse or touch when slowly looking around while running. They should really learn from ZZZ. View is smooth there. English voice is missing from so many places. Lip syncing is also wrong in many many scenes for english voice."

meow,4,its a good game but too much fan service and they can barely make poc in a land thats representing poc
Ben Lev,5,"As a F2P, coming back to the game after not playing since launch was a satisfying experience. So much content to explore straight away. A lot of characters added that contribute to the deck. Even a card game was added. The Archon, World and Story quests are well written. Tons of content to explore and go through. Ended up playing more on my phone than on console even at home."
Stacy Cupcake,3,Love it and all but it needs alot of storage I literally deleted alot of my games just for it to say clear more I mean it's a pretty game love the character Design the lore the story the art the Music its all a 10 its an amazing game! But it needs alot of spaceüòî
Shoaib Ali,5,Nice game
Erika Rich Ventura,3,"I LOVE THE GRAPICS, GAMEPLAY, LORE, AND THE CHARACTER DESIGNNNN! also could yall PLEASE redo citali's design because she should be a GRANNY. OLD. Not a highschool looking gorl who has a crush on Aether.."

Vanshika Rajdev,5,Quite heavy RPG game but I like every elements.
Donny Rahman,1,"Developer tolol blunder parah story natlan gajelas, gaguna babi hapus aja gamenya bisu impek."
JC Banton,1,"i love everything about this game but except the fact the bad designs, diversity, and personalities of the characters honestly pains me physically and mentally. For example, Citlali having a crush for Aether is honestly such a weird thing and she is just plain loli bait when she's supposed to be this ""granny"". The big eyes, plushies and pillows make me feel like she isn't really the same person she was on 5.1.."

Samothrace,1,"Changing my review 4 years later because this game seems to be going in a direction that doesn't suit me. If you're here to collect male characters bc you saw pretty art on Twitter, this ain't it. They're not releasing anymore male characters."
Nitin shekhawat,5,I have never played a game like this in my life oh my

Sharul,5,Bole la
Yogendra Tiwari,5,Way too good than expected
Let Log,2,"The game is great, but the experience in playing is pretty painful. Mainly stems on explorations and no skip button. Exploration cause climbing a high cliff, reaching a occulus that is way up the air is painful to do and the solution the devs did is to incorporate it to a character. They incentivises to pull that character just because of that and I hated it the devs essencially lock a small QOL behind paywall. Second is the skip button. Just put one cuz not everyone has a time to spare"
Jaries Canayon,2,GIVE ME BACK THE NON FANSERVICE CITLALI PLEASE. 5.3 better be so peak it'll make me forget about the fanservice.
Sibelle Harb,5,Awesome!!!
Lili,1,"I have been playing Genshin since 2021, and I love this game so much. But recently, Genshin just keeps disappointing. Where are the male characters?! This year we've only gotten 4 male characters; 3 of them were 4* and Kinich was the only 5*. This is unfair to us, female players, and everyone that wants more male characters. Kinich, Ororon & Capitano were also cast aside in the Archon Quests. Literally, it feels like it's just a bare minimum. Natlan was pretty disappointing as well. Do better."
Nur Rashidah,5,Good game
Gopal Dss,5,That is a pretty good game
Rain Clouds,1,"This game has been complete trash ever since Liu Wei the gooner took over management(the same guy who said men in their 30s love 16-18yr old teens girls the mostü§¢ü§Æ). I refuse to call him ""Da Wei"" since it's just a nickname meaning Big Wei and we all know he's overcompensating for something that is far from big. We can all see the direction Genshin Impact is going for the past year since he took over and it's been nothing but mindless fanservicing to the most depraved incels."
M K,1,"I've been playing Genshin since its release and have enjoyed many aspects of the game. However, as someone who appreciates male characters, I've found the recent direction of the game extremely disappointing. It feels like the content and character releases are heavily focused on catering to ""waifu"" fans, leaving those who enjoy male characters with fewer options. It's clear the developers are responding to a specific audience, this shift has made me feel alienated as a long-time player."
Thedump Guy,5,No comments. It's absolutely amazing this game is!!!
Nikesh Vishwakarma,3,I just started playing so give me some time
Tim Justine Ingco,4,"Loved this game but PLEASE FIX THE GRAPHICS GLITCH IN SOME PHONES im using an OPPO A94 it glitches on dvalin and signora boss and i dont have dmg text, Ice and grass pls Fix this game on my device id rate 5 star if you fix it please i already played so much of your game"
Raine Ashley Vidamo,5,"Its quite a good game for people that like freeplay games!the lore is really good are intresting, and the charaters are good but the comunity is really rude and weird but its definetly recomended"
Elliot Anderson,3,"I've loved this game for years, but seriously what is happening with natlan male characters, every region we get less 5 star male characters? What is happening?"
Kuber Agarwal,5,Great game
blackcloverongoing 10,5,Great
Yomiko Alejandrino,5,Honestly this is like botw it has the same mechanic like climbing gliding and stamina but it's just better than botw because it's big has multiplayer and more mechanics than botw ever had but I did wish the game size wasn't so big like 30 gb and that they would also add a skip dialogue feature because they are just so many dialogue but aside that it's pretty good and I really really liked the story this is a 10/10 for me
Faris Danish,5,Perfection

AKM 04,1,"1. Newer characters are extremely powerful than old ones which make me feel as if my old characters are useless 2. Poor balancing. Meta keeps changing too quick 3. Game is extremely repetitive at end game. 4. Eventhough the resin is increased to 200 it still isnt doing much, it needs a reserved resin system like honkai star rail or something else it's extremely hard to catchup after coming back after not playing for a long time. 5. Earning primo is a pain and not very easy - way worse than HSR"
Ayesha Plaba,2,"Errmm it was great n all fontaine is its peak the new nation ""natlan"" isnt all that great specifically characacter designs now citlali is a good design but i hate her 5.3 attitude i like 5.1 citlali more and the lore is good and the rewards are great."
MoonMoon,2,"Dear developers, I've been facing this problem for a month now where I already downloaded the new version update but then it asks me for an additional 6 GB, and when I do download them it starts ""splitting old resources"" then lags at around 39% and doesn't continue, so I closed the game and reopened it only to find it asking for another 6 GB (Note: those 6 GB are not part of the main update package and they don't take any storage). It's been a month of this, what should I do? Please do fix it"
Lanlan Zhao,5,This game is amazing in my own opinion there's sometimes lag while I play but no other further problems! (Make sure you have a lot of gb left in your storage to play this game!)
B.,1,"I've been playing since 2022, and I genuinely liked this game ever since. The characters, the exploration, the music are incredible. However, in the last patches Hoyo has been messing up. The lack of diversification in African/Latino-inspired cultures, bad and nonsensical designs, lack of male chars, infantilization of a‚Ä¶ wise chief known as 'granny'? C'mon. Among another issues. I can't believe this game is worsening. It's really sad, but there's not much to do."
Dennis del Rosario,1,"Played this game for three years daily. Did everything to keep my account secure, even avoiding multi-player. Haven't been able to login for more than a week. We play games to have fun when we want. When I'm denied that by not being able to login to play; it disqualifies that game from my play list. Might come back when Skirk drops. Hoyo denied my daily grind so uninstall for me."
Jake Ramos,1,Abbys too hard not for F2P >:(

Acong Acong,5,Nice game
Hamid Uddin,5,It is a very exciting game...!!
Jejomar Pedraza,1,"I would rate it negative 5 star if i can, Natlan is a flop for me. Scrapping Xbalanque and wasting capitano for the sake of generic waifus. For the next 6 months, there are only 2 males and both are useless 4stars, there's no more Male 5star for the entirety of 5.x patch so that makes only 1 Male 5star for 1 year or 2 (assuming 2025 will also not make any 5 star male) i hate this so much, you know males are in-demand yet you refuse to make even the slightest effort, i wasted 4 years, Uninstalled"

Angela Cruz,5,"I've been playing genshin for at least two years now, but I still don't think I'd get tired of it. The genshin community is very fun, and I would and have recommended it to others. To be honest, this game is why I have a gambling addiction in the game (lol). I love xiao!!!"
Jedidiah Apolonio,2,"I hate what this game is turning into. At first, it was fun, it was based on a fantasy world but now with the release of natlan, everything is just turning modern. Don't get me started on the female designs, Citlali is supposed to be a grandma isn't she? Then why the hell is she acting like some teenager crushing over aether? Don't you listen to the players' complaints about this game? Have you ever tried changing the designs? This game was supposed to be a fantasy game, why is it so modern?"
Natilie Mcqueen,1,"Why do I have to wait literally 2 hours to download resources? It takes too long, and I just wanna see what the game is like. 1 star, get better"

Star Peep,1,I agree with the first review comment on it becoming a waifu game. And there is some suspicion that you changed the story post-Fontaine.
finky ishere,1,Huh
Cayden Davis,5,Very fun story
Andrew,3,I think it okay but when you open the app it takes so long
Josie Ferguson-Hughes,4,"It is an absolute GORGEOUS game. Emphasis on gorgeous. The graphics, even on mobile, are phenomenal. Exploration, quest lines, lore, character design and etc are probably one of the best things I've seen. The only downside? The Primogems. They're a struggle to obtain. I just wish there was a domain or a quest that you could do multiple times in a row to get primogems. Probably not 50 gems, but 20 or 30 and you can do it multiple times in a row. Still adore the game however!"

Olivia Gray,5,"I love this game so much but I will admit it takes up alot of space and has trouble with lagging and loading but that's only if you play it on your phone so I recommend playing on a gaming console. The art style and animation is beautiful and looks like it took alot of time and effort to make. The stories and quests are really fun. And I find it fun to try and work hard to get characters , it's very rewarding. Also make sure you get a lyre to play because it sounds so pretty."

Ana Maria,2,"Meh it's okay, haven't played the new Natlan update but to be honest I feel like it's getting boring. It's catering too much to creeps, while male characters are covered up most of the female characters are dressed up in literal bikinis. It's honestly disappointing, not to mention the lack of diversity in skin color and the downgrade of character designs. It's just not as intriguing and captivating as it used to be. I hope it takes a turn for the better and that it doesn't follow ZZZ's path.."
se xy,1,"update: repetitive, sometimes boring, makes me feel im all alone in this game"
Kuriyama Novel,1,Trash
Jazzie B,5,Very good game
Alex Ivanof,1,"I've been playing Genshin since version 1.6 and have loved it since. But the fact that only one new male 5-star got released for the entire year of 2024 is ridiculous. It feels like since the Natlan release all of the male characters have been pushed to the side. They try to shove as many ""hot women"" in your face as possible during the new AQ but it all comes off weird because none of them even feel like real people. I miss when Genshin cared about its story and characters and I may stop playing"
Tamim Man,1,This game is fully haram for other religious activists. That's why I'm now deleting this game
