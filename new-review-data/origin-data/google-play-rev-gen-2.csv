The game is great, the graphics are stunning, and the stories are nice. However, it's very long and excessive. It makes it feel more like a chore. As you get more into the end game, getting rewards is a struggle, and farming and upgrading characters is more of a hassle than it should be. The resin (energy) cap should be upgraded, or costs of energy should be lowered. This game is very good, just time consuming.",88,"October 09, 2024",2024-10-09T00:08:20Z,
